description: scRUBYt! is an easy to learn and use, yet powerful and effective web scraping framework. It's most interesting part is a Web-scraping DSL built on HPricot and WWW::Mechanize, which allows to navigate to the page of interest, then extract and query data records with a few lines of code. It is hard to describe scRUBYt! in a few sentences - you have to see it for yourself!
